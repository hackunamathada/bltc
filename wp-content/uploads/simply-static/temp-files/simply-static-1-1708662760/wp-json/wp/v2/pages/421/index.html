The training is approached through primary and secondary objectives. The primary objective is to train through our formal training schools such as the Bible College, Church Planters Training Schools and discipleship program through the DCI curriculum. Our secondary objective relates to short term training and seminars for existing church leaders and mission workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3e6db4669b50855959d7439403259a82\" style=\"font-size:15px\">In addition, we focus on holistic ministries like health care ministry through free medical camps, qualitative education for children through our schools and conduct awareness camps for various social issues. We also introduce income generation projects on a small scale in the rural areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9164ed2e2e30a285e2570c57528ba42b\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We are blessed with committed staff workers and trustworthy partners who share our burdens and help carry the load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Statement of Faith<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b02ef863c380dedd3567196a9db81ee2\" style=\"font-size:15px\">This doctrinal statement reflects the broad, mainstream, conservative evangelical tradition which is consistent with the teachings of the Bible and which has stood the test of history and experience. We specifically affirm the following doctrinal truth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Scriptures<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-54db1d8eabd9a6ad8e39a91694a5b529\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that the entire Bible is the inspired Word of God and that men of God \u201cwere moved by the Holy Spirit\u201d to write the very word of Scripture. The Bible is therefore without error (inerrant) in its original manuscripts. God has supernaturally preserved the Bible and it is the sole and final authority for faith and life providing encouragement, guidance, comfort and instruction for training in righteousness (2 Tim 3:16-17; 2 Pet.1: 20-21).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Godhead (Trinity)<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9d59b831824657377d6c946a53c25457\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, each of who is fully and equally God; possesses all of the divine nature and attributes, and is totally worthy of our worship and service (Deut.6: 4; Matt 28:19; John 1:14, 10:30; Cor.13: 14).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">God the Father<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-dbc0bde39714bbb873c676e36e351935\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that God the Father is the first person of the Trinity and is the eternal, unchanging, all-powerful, all-knowing, all-wise, all-loving, completely just and perfectly holy, sovereign Ruler and Sustainer of the universe. He is the father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the Father of all true believers (Gen.1: 1, Eph.4: 6, John 1: 12-13, 5:19-21, 17: 1-5; Is.40: 21-28, 43: 10-13, 46: 8-11; Rom.8: 14-16).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">God the Son<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-298fc421226e128137485c5d90c0f046\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity and is the only begotten eternal Son of God Who became flesh to reveal God to man, to fulfill prophecy, and to become the Savior of the lost world. In becoming man Jesus did not cease in any way to be God so that He is fully God and fully man inseparably united in one person forever. Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit; born of the Virgin Mary; lived a sinless life; died on the cross as the substitutionary, all-sufficient atoning sacrifice for all of the sins of all men of all time; was buried; bodily rose from the dead; physically ascended into heaven in His glorified, resurrected body; is seated at the right hand of the Father performing His ministry of intercession; will return and conclude human history and consummate God\u2019s eternal plan by executing judgment and ushering in His Millennial Kingdom reign to be followed by the eternal state John 1:1, 14, 18, 3:16; Luke 1:30-35; Phil 2:5-8; Col. 2:3, 9; Mark 10:45; Acts 2:22-24; John 1:29; Rom. 3:25-26; Heb. 10:5-14; 1Pet. 2:24, 3:18; John 20:20; Phil. 3:20-21; Heb. 1:3; Rom. 8:34; 1John 2:1; Acts 1:11; Heb. 9:28; 1Thess. 4:13-18; 2 Thess. 2:7; Matt. 24:44; Rev. 19:11-21; Rev. 21-22)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">God the Holy Spirit<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-929c6e810879fb602e04172f41bf4d9f\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity Who specially came into the world on the day of Pentecost to glorify Christ and to enable men to appropriate the salvation wrought by Christ. He is the primary agent for the conviction of sin and for regeneration. Simultaneously with salvation, the Holy Spirit imparts new life, baptizes the believer into the body of Christ (His church), permanently indwells the believer, and securely seals the believer unto the day of redemption. The Holy Spirit fills (directs and controls) those believers who are yielded to Him, enables believers to bear fruit, and empowers believers to live a life free from sin\u2019s dominion. We also believe that the Holy Sprit gives scripture. (1 Cor. 13:8, 14:22; John 16:7-15; 1 Cor. 6:19, 12:13; Eph. 1:13-14, 4:30; Gal. 5:16-17, 22-23; Rom. 8-5-13; 1Pet. 4:10-11; Rom. 12:3-8)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Man<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6dcb72f58e858ab7d44300314812165e\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that man was created in the image of God by direct act of God and did not come into being as the result of evolution. Man was created to glorify God, worship and serve Him, and have fellowship with Him. Man fell through sin by disobeying God, thus incurring both physical and spiritual death, which alienate him from God. Man\u2019s nature was thus corrupted and he is utterly lost, \u201cdead in trespasses and sins,\u201d and totally incapable of saving himself and coming back into right relationship with God by his own merit or effort (Gen. 1:26, 2:6,17, 3:17-24; Is, 59:1-2; Rom. 3:9-19,23, 5:6-8; Luke 18:26-27; Eph. 2:1-3).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Satan<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-746da20315e029115b11a58441173be0\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that Satan is the instigator of evil and a real spirit being, not simply the personification of evil. He is a fallen angel who, under the sovereign permission of God, has been given temporary ruler ship of the earth. He was utterly defeated at the cross, but the execution of his judgment has been postponed by God until after the Millennial Kingdom when he will be cast into the eternal lake of fire. In the meantime, he deceives the world and seeks to establish his counterfeit kingdom on earth to discredit and blaspheme God and to tempt, accuse, attack and destroy believers. He can be resisted by the believer through faith and reliance on the power of the Holy Spirit (Gen. 3:1-5; Is. 14:12-17; Ezek. 28:11-19; Job 1-2; 1 John 5:19; 2 Cor. 11:14; 1 Tim. 3:6; 1 Pet. 5:8-9; James 4:7; Rev. 12:9, 20:1-3, 7-10).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Salvation<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that the shed blood of Jesus Christ on the cross provides the sole basis for forgiveness of sins and salvation, which is the free gift of God\u2019s grace. Salvation is affected by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit and cannot be secured by man\u2019s works or personal merit. Salvation is only appropriated b a person placing his faith in the finished work of Christ. Repentance is a turning toward God and away from sin and is a part of but not separate from believing faith. \u201cThe Gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes\u201d and those who receive Jesus Christ by faith are born again, have their sins forgiven, become children of God, are a new creation in Christ, and \u201care sealed by the Holy Spirit unto the day of redemption\u201d, being kept by the power of God (Eph. 1:7; 13-14; John 1:12-13, 3:1-7, 14-16; 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 1:16, 10:9-10, Eph. 2:8-10; Rom. 8:14-17, 31-39; John 10:27-29, 14:6; Acts 26:20; 1Pet. 1:3-5)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Christian Life<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-da8dd9144f9b767c96fb3fcfab77e016\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that every Christian should live for Christ and not for himself and should, by the power of the indwelling Spirit, allow Christ to manifest His life through him to God\u2019s glory. By ever increasing obedience to the word of God, each believer should mature and progressively become more like Jesus. In the power of the Spirit, each believer should live a holy life; not fulfill the lusts of the flesh; exercise his spiritual gifts to build up the body of Christ; witness for Christ; be personally involved in making disciples to fulfill the Great Commission; perform good works and bear fruit to the glory of God (Gal. 2:20; 1Pet. 1:15-16, 2:11; 2Cor. 5:14-15; Rom. 6:11-13; Eph. 2:10, 4:11-12, 4:22-24; 1 Pet. 4:10-11; Acts 1:8; Mat. 28:18-20; Col. 1:10; John 15:8, 16)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Church<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6e308c479281f659f9e2a8a979787909\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that the church is the body of Christ of which Jesus is the Head and whose members are those who have truly received Christ by faith. The local church is the tangible expression of the body of Christ in a particular location. Since all members of the body of Christ are united in Christ by the same Spirit, they should live in love, harmony and unity, being intent on the same purpose and accepting those sectarians or denominational practices which are based on a sincere interpretation of the Bible, which do not relate to substantive doctrinal matters, and which do not in practice cause disunity or hinder the ministry. The purpose of the church is to make Christ known to lost men, to make disciples, and glorify God on earth (acts 1:8; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Eph. 1:20:23, 4:1-6, 4:12-16; Matt. 28:18-20; John 17; Col. 1:24-29)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Ordinances<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2421bbbfb575e76cfc8110b4ea8e2688\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that the only two ordinances of the church recognized by Scripture are water baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper. Water baptism by immersion is an act of obedience following salvation, which symbolically pictures the believer\u2019s death to sin, burial of the old life, and resurrection to new life. The Lord\u2019s Supper celebrates fellowship and communion with Christ, symbolically commemorates His death, and anticipates His second coming (Matt. 28: 19; Acts 10:47-48; Luke. 22:19-20; 1Cor. 11:23-28; Rom. 6:3-4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Eternal Destiny of Men<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7d2796e5961050d17b56f8f400a203a8\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe that at death every believer consciously and immediately enters into the presence and fellowship of the Lord to wait for the physical resurrection and glorification of his body at Christ\u2019s return. The believer will thus enjoy life eternal with God-fellowshipping, serving and worshipping Him forever (2Cor. 5:6; 1 Cor. 15:12-58; Luke 23:39-43; 1Thess. 4:13-18; John 3:16; Rev. 21-22). We believe that at death every unbeliever consciously and immediately enters into separation from the Lord to wait for the physical resurrection of his body to everlasting condemnation, judgment and punishment (Luke 16:19-31; John 3:18, 36; Rev. 20:5, 11-15; 2Thess. 1:5-10)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future Things<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-560b70271158041d9db5ccf8fab217a9\" style=\"font-size:15px\">We believe the next prophetic event will be the rapture of the Church when the Lord Jesus Christ will return in the air to receive unto Himself all Church Age believer (John 14:1-3; Titus 2:11-14; 1 Cor. 15:51-52; 1Thess. 4:13-18; Phil. 3:20-21). The rapture of the Church will be followed by the seven-year Great Tribulation period in fulfillment of Dan. 9:24-27 and as described in Rev. 6:1-19:21 during which Israel will be purified, the whole world tested, and the wrath o God poured out against sin (Jer. 30:7; Matt. 24; Rev. 3:10; 1Thess. 5:9-11). We believe that at the end of the Great Tribulation the Lord Jesus Christ in His second coming will personally and physically return to the earth just as He ascended with great power and glory to execute judgment and usher in the Millennial Kingdom, during which He will reign on earth for 1000 years with righteousness, justice and peace to fulfill God\u2019s covenant promise to Israel (Acts 1:8-11; Rev. 19:11-21; Ezek. 37:21-28; Is. 11:9; Rev. 20:1-6). We believe that the 1000 year reign of Christ on earth will be followed by the judgment of Satan when he is cast into the lake of fire; forever; the Great White Throne Judgment and bodily resurrection for unbelievers; the creation of a new heave and new earth; and eternal state (Rev. 20-22; 2 Pet. 3: 1-14).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Purpose:\u00a0The leadership Training Centre was started in the year 1993 by Peter and Moala Kashung with a purpose of making known the love of God to humanity through various training programs and schools.
